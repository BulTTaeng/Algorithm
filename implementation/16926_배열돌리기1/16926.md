## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16926>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Implementation.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I use 2 array rather than saving temp.

Rotate the outside of array first and rotate inside after.

We have to min(N,M)/2 depth to rotate because we are rotating 2 rows and cols at one time.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
