# 16956_WolfAndSheep

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16956

## What Algorithm should I use?

Implementation

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Little bit ridiculous problem. I don't know why it is in graph section.

We don't have to make min fence(D). So, if we see wolf(W) , surround it with fence will work.

Just make exception for wolfs are in the near section or sheep is right next to wolf which leads to impossible case.

Maybe this can solved by BFS.

Making the min fence will be more complecated problem. 
Maybe that can be solved by graph algorithm.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
