## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1213>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If we have more than 2 odd number of same alphabet , we cannot make palindrome.

So, check if we have more than 2 odd number , and if we have it , put it in the middle.

Before that , we have to add (The number of alphabet appeared)/2 in the front and reverse of it at the end.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
