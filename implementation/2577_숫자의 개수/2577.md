# 2577_TheNumber

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2577

## What Algorithm should I use?

Implementation? Calculation?

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Umm...

I saw this at mypage in 백준.

This was the problem that I tried but I failed.

I think I solve this when I was 20 years old (when I got D0 in C programing).

This is very very easy problem for me now but in that time, maybe it was hard problem.

This problem teach me not to hurry. It is like it is saving you are doing great.

Ha Ha... 

Cheer up!!!

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
