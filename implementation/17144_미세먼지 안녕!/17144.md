## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17144>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Implementation.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have to save another array for not apply updated value.(use prev value while diffusion).

I use queue to save the location of dust.

I only save the dust which size is bigger than 5 , because we abandon under decimal point.

After that , rotate, and find the sum.

Becareful not to add two -1. (Or we can just start adding with 2).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
