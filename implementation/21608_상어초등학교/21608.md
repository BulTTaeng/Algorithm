## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/21608>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Implementation.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I just follow the steps in the problem.

First , I save empty space near every location.

The (1,1) ( 1 ,N) (N,1) (N,N) will have 2 near empty space and if one of x and y is 1 or N, it will have 3 empty space.

Except for that it have 4.

After that searching from (1,1) to (N,N) , save student in the right sequence, I find the proper location using the statement in the problem.

If we found best location , save it and put the student in best location.

When filling up the student is done, again , searching from (1,1) to (N,N) , find the score.
