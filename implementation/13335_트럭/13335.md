## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

Simulation

## What was the key point and the hard part?

1. Move all trucks on the bridge

2. If next truck can get on the brige, move next truck.

3. While doing 1,2 save the location and number of trucks which are on the brige. If last truck is on the bridge , print the time+W.
