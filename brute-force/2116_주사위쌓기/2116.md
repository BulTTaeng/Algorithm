## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2116>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Nothing?

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We will have just one option for dice that are not in the bottom because we have to make numbers in bottom and top same.

We have 6 options for bottom dice.

If we select some number as dice bottom for bottom dice, we should check biggest number except for top and bottom.

If bottom is A , top is F.

If bottom is B , top is D.

If bottom is C , top is E.

Do calculation for 6 case of bottom dice and find the max value.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
