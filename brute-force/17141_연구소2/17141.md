## What Algorithm should I use?

bfs, combination

## What was the key point and the hard part?

1. find possilbe combination of location of virus.

2. copy input and do simulation.

3. while doing simulation, use bfs to fill the coped input.

4. if coped array have 0 (have a place that is not infected) does not update the answer.

5. if not 4 , save the minimum answer.
