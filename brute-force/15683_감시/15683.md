## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15683>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Simulation

## What was the key point and the hard part?

It was hard sumulation problem.(빡구현)

We have to consider all possible cases and find the answer.

While doing simulation, we should not just check that we are monitoring some location or not.

Because many camera can monitoring same location, just one camera turned does not mean that location can be new location to check.

To check the number of cameras that monitoring location, I use multiple of 7. num % 7 is the number of cameras watching that location.

I decrease the blind spot when some location's value is 0 , not multiple of 7.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
