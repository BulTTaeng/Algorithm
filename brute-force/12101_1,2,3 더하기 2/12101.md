## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/12101>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Back-tracking , complete-search.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Save the operation in the string.

Because we can only use 1 to 3 , compute all possible case and count when we reach N.

If we reach N K times , save them and return every thing.

Print the saved answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
