## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3085>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Brute-force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Brute force is always hard because I think a lot to find a better solution.

In here , the size of array is (50 * 50) , So if we swap all possible cases and search longest one, it will match in time.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
