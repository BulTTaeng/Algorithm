## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16922>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Brute-force , Complete Search

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was that I thought this is dp problem and tried to find some recurrence relation.

I cannot find the solution and I read the problem carefully and I notice that there is only 20 length is possible and

the maximum value will be less or same with 1000.

So, I use complete search to solve this.

If I check all value which length is equal to N , I cannot find the answer because there might be check value in the 
middle of making N length number. (ex, If N == 2 and visit[VV(10)] is checked , I cannot search L)

So, I make 2d array to check the visit with the length of array.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
