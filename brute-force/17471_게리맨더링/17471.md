## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17471>

## What Algorithm should I use?

dfs , brute-force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We can put some city in first section or second section.

Find all possible cases and check first section and second section have at least one city.

After that by doing dfs or bfs , check that we can visit all city which means we don't have unconnected city.

After that , find sum of first section and second section and compare.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
