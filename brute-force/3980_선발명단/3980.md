## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3980>

## What Algorithm should I use?

complete-search

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , I think that this can work with complete - search.

10! can be done in less than 1 second but if T increase this might not work.

However , I see that there is 5 players maximum in one positon, so I determine to use complete - search and it works.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
