## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17281>

## What Algorithm should I use?

brute-force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have to find permutation to solve this.

Check that number 1 player's location is always 4.

After finding permutation, do simulation. We have to check the number of start player, state of base to count score and out count.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
