## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

에라토스테네스의 체 , prime number

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Just check 2 ~ sqrt(N) to check it is prime number or not.

Compare start to length of N / 2 to check it is palindrome or not.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
