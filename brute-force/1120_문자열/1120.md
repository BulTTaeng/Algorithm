## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1120>

## What Algorithm should I use?

brute-force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If we can add char at the begin and end, it means we just need to find the difference between string A and B while switcing the start location of B.

Because A is always shorter than B , this will work without segment fault.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
