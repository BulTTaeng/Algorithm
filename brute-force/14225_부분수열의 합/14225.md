## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14225>

## What Algorithm should I use?

brute-force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

There is 2 options when we meet some number in the input array.

1. add it

2. pass

Searching from 0 index to N-1 index, calculate all possible cases and mark it in visit array.

When searching is done , find the smallest nubmer not visited with linear search.
