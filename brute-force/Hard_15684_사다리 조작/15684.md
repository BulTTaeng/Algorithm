## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15684>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Simulation , combination , back tracking

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Find possible combination to select (0~3) ladders.

If we found possible cases , break and print the result (because we don't have to find case that needs bigger letters)

If we can not found it, print -1.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
