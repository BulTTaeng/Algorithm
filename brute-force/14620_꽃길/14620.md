## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

Complete - search

## What was the key point and the hard part?

First , I calculate the cost of flower and save them.

Because we cannot plant the flower at edge location , we have to check (1~N-2).

After that find all possible combination with complte search and find the min value.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
