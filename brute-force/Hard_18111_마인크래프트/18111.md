## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/18111>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Brute_force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The problem is that I should think that I can check 0~256 height cases because the range of number is not so large.

I save the number of ? height field in the num[?] array.

After that , we will find if we can make all field's height same as 'i'.

Because we need blocks before we puts blocks on the top, I search max -> min so we can get blocks before we need.

If we calculate min -> max sequence , we might think possible case as impossible case.

Find the min time and large h if time is same, print it.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
