## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1182>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Complete search

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was that I cannot catch the end point.

I thought if sum is same with T, increase the answer.

However , as we can see in the example input, if target num is zero, It have some problem.

Because we start search with sum == 0, the start point gets in to the answer.

We have to check (sum + inp[index]) is same with target number.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
