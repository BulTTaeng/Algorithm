## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2961>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Complete search

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we have 2 option to do (put it in , not put it in) , calculate all case and find the min diff.

I search internet and I found I can solve it by using combination.

Also , I see that searching from (sour1 * sour2 * ... * sourN , bit1 * bit2 ... * bitN) and divide selected one also work. 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
