## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2239>

## What Algorithm should I use?

back-tracking

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have 3 information to check.

Row , Col , sub square

So, check if we have number (0~8) in (0~8) row , colr , square.

If we don't do simulation using back-tracking.
