## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14889>

## What Algorithm should I use?

comple-search , permutation

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Use visit array to check all possible permutation.

If the number of one team reaches to N/2 , calculte the power of each team (we need to calculate permutation again here), and find the min diff.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
