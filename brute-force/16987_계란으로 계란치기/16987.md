## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16987>

## What Algorithm should I use?

back tracking.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Save the number of broken eggs and the number of egg that we are grabing.

If grabed egg has already broken, grab next egg.

If grabed egg is not broken , find eggs that has not broken and crash two eggs.

Check both eggs are broken or not. Update the number of broken eggs if eggs are broken.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
