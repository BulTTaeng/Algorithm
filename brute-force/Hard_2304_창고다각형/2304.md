## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2304>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Brute-force , Stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was thinking that I should divide input in to 3 section.

Left + tallest + Right.

While searching 0 to N, find the max height until now and if new max value appear, add the ared to the answer.
While searching N to 0, find the max height until now and if new max value appear, add the ared to the answer.

After that , because we did not add tallest one , add tallest height to the answer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found some interesting solution in the internet.

Use stack and add max height until now  min x(width) loc to tallest one's x loc.
Add max height until now  max x(width) loc to tallest one's x loc.

The tallest one can be added twice so we have to contain = in just one side
[min x(width) loc to tallest one's x loc]
[max x(width) loc to tallest one's x loc)

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
