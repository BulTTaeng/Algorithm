## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1038>

## What Algorithm should I use?

brute-force , dp

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The decreasing number starts with 0 and 1,2,3.... 9 ... goes on.

Because the number in the last location should be smaller than previouse one, we can see that we can add

1 + 0

2 + (1 , 0)

3 + (2, 1 , 0)

.

.

.

9 + (8, 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 ,2 , 1 , 0)

So, we will put 0~9 first and find the Nth value with 

Number * 10 + (0, 1 , 2, .... ,last num - 1).

If we cannot fill Nth location, it means we don't have Nth decreasing number so, print -1.

Be careful that we have to print 0 if the N is 0.
