## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15970>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Sorting

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I use 5000 priority queue to solve this.

Because we want to find the closest one , I think sort them and compare near 2 components will work.

Compare range and prev , curr , pq.top().

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
