## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3108>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Geometry , Union find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If square is outside or inside of another square , we have to put up tutle's head.

So, starting from(0,0,0,0) , I Union squares that meets.

After that I find the number of gruoup.

The answer will be tha group-1 because we don't have to include (0,0,0,0) group.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
