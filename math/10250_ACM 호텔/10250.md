## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/10250>

## What Algorithm should I use?

...

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have to consider no remainder case

6 12 6 should be 601 not 2.

If dividing have to remainder, we have to set floor as H and decrease the room nubmer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
