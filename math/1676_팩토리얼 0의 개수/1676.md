## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1676>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Math

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because the max number we multiply is 500 , we cannot make 4 zeroes in the end.

I save last 3 numbers of factorial. After multiplying is done, I check the number of zeroes in the end ans save, erase it.  

After that , I multply last 3 numbers not all the number of factorial and repeat this sequence.

The final answer would be the saved number of zeroes.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
