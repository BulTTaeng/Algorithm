## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1629>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Divide-and-conquer

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because 0<A,B,C<INT_MAX, I cannot just iterate all multiplication.

A^2b = A^b * A^b

(A * B)% C = (A%C * B%C) % C

Because we know this equation and relation, we can just check the MOD of number and if the B is even , we can get MOD of { A^(B/2) * A^(B/2) } % C.

With this, we can decrease the number of calculation.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
