## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/10830>

## What Algorithm should I use?

divide - and - conquer;

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We don't have to multiply matrix one by one.

A^2x = A^x * A^x

We can use this to solve this.

If we have to find A^y and y is odd, we can just 

A^y-1 * A

= A^(y-1)/2 * A^(y-1)/2 * A


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
