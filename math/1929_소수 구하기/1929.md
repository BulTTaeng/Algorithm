## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1929>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Sieve of Eratosthenes

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We don't have find multiple 0 to N.

Because proved by sieve of Eratosthenes, we have to check until sqrt(N). 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
