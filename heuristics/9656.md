# 9656_StoneGame2

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/9656

## What Algorithm should I use?

heuristics

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If the number of left stone is 1 or 3, the player who have turn will loss. (1 1 1 or 3)

The number of stone = 1

CY

The number of stone = 2

SK

The number of sone = 3

CY

From this point, i-3 i-1 will be always same because the winner of i-1 and i-3 is same.

So, just find the remainder in division of the number of stone can give a answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
