# 9655_StoneGame

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

Heuristics

## What was the key point and the hard part?

*Player can take 1 or 3 stones (not 1~3)*

Little bit ridiculous problem.

Let's check the possible cases.

1 stone = SK

2 stones = CY (because the number of stones are less than 3, there is no option for SK except for taking 1 stone)

3 stones = SK

4 stones = CY

In here I notice that if SK takes 1 stone in 4 stones, it becomes the same stone game which the number of stone is 3 and CY takes first turn.

If SK takes 3 stones in 4 stones, it becomes the same stone game which the number of stone is 1 and CY takes first turn.

This means if SK wins (i-3) and (i-1) stone game, it means what ever SK takes, CY can win.

SK will win if CY wins (i-3) and (i-1) stone game.

However, because 1~3 stone games, the pattern is SK ,CY , SK, ... This means, if n is even, CY will win and if n is odd SK will win.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
