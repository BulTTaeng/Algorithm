## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/10610>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Math , greedy, sorting

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The key was thet if adding all number of digit % 3 is 0, that number is multiple of 3.

Because we need multiple of 30 not 3, another thing that we have to consider is that the number have zero or not.

Because we can have 10^5 digit, long long will not be enought, so use string or vector to get input.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
