## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1202>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The main idea is not to check jewels twice.

Sort jewels with weight and backpack in increasing order.

Push every jewels weight is less than current weight in the priority_queue.

If the jewels is heavier , get the top of pq and add the answer.

Beaware that we have to make answer as long long type.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
