## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17503>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Sorting , binary search

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was that if we cannot get beer every day, the answer is -1. (Does not matter we satisfied or not).

Find the number with binary search and if we satisfied, save the min value.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
