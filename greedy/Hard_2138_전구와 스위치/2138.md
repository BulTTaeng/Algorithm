## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2138>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

It was easy to know that we have to check (index-1) and press (index) because it is last chance to change (index-1).

However, checking (0) index was hard.

We cannot know which case is better (pressing 0 index, not pressing 0 index) , so we have to consider both situation and find min.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
