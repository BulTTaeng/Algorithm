## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/19539>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The sum of hight should be divided by 3 because we should put 3 water a day.

With it , we can figure it out how many days will take.

So, if we can put 2 water in every day, the answer is "YES" because 1 can be put in everywhere.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
