## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1080>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we can only edit number in (0,0) with (0~2)(0~2) square, we have to start from 0,0 to N-3,M-3 and if it is not same, we have to change.

Then answer cannot be -1 eventhough N<3 || M<3 because they might same.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
