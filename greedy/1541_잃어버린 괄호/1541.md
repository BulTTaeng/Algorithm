## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1541>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Greedy , Parsing

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , I think about vector or stack or dfs(Combination) to solve it.

However , deleting and adding cost is expansive in vector and stack, and the time cost of dfs takes a lot.

I notice that If there is a minus in the equation, after that , every number can be changed to minus number.

So, I check if '-' appeared , and if it does , add the prev number to the answer and after that , I minus all the numbers appearing.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
