## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1052>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy 

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I notice I have to change N to binary number and I have to make 1 less than K.

I cannot catch the impossible case, but there is no impossilbe case...

Just increase N and compute the N%2 ==1 (1 when changes N to binary == the bottle that we need) and 

if it is less than K , N - original N is the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
