## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15903>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because number increasing is the sum of card that we select, we have to choose smallest number.

I use priority_queue to sort and pop 2 elements, add and insert.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
