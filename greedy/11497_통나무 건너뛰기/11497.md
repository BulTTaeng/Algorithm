## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11497>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy , sorting

## What was the key point and the hard part?

What we have to do is minimize the difference between 2 numbers.

To do that , sort the input and check input[i] , input[i-2] because it will be bigger than input[i] - input[i-1].

The first on should be check with input[1] and input[2] because we assume [N-1] is next to [0]

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
