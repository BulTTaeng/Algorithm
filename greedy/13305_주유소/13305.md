## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/13305>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The problem was that I miss read the statement.

I thought every road can be 10000000000.

So, I tried to use string multiplication and adding.

Howerver , I notice that sum is less than 1000000000, so I use long long.

We don't have to fill the fuel if there is cheaper one.

So, keepin adding the road length and if we found cheaper price , min price until now * added road length.

Set min price again and repeat this until we reach (final destination index(N)  -1 ).

Be cause we cannot fill the fuel at Nth city, add min price unti(N-1) * added road.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
