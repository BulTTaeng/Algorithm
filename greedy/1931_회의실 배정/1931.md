## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1931>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Typical greedy algorithm problem.

Beaware that we have to sort it by endtime and start time if you want to compare only endtime.

If we compare start time and endtime both , we can do it not sorting it by start time.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
