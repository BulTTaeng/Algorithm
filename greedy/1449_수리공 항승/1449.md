## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1449>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have to block every hole.

Rather than put tape on the hole, we rather put tape at max location after sorting.

If next hole is blocked by the tape that I put , pass the hole.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
