## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1461>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy , priority queue

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because in the last time, we don't have to come back, we can save one way distance.

So, the we should visit longest distance at last.

Because we can hold M books, pop M element in pq and add to the answer.

Except for first one, we have to add round way distance(*2)

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
