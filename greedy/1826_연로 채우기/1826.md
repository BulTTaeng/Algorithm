## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1826>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Greedy , priority_queue

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We should visit gas station that have largest fuel that we can reach.

I use 2 priority queue. one is for save station's location.

The other one is for save largest fuel that I can get until now.

If we can not reach next station or Destination, print -1 else print answer.
