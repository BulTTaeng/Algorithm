# Hard_19940_PizzaOven

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/19940

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs , greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The first problem is that print int dictionary sequence.

I thought less ADDH is more faster so I put in a queue in these sequence(ADDH, ADDT, MINT, ADDO, MINO).

However , dictionary sequence is opposite... (MINO , ADDO , MINT , ADDT , ADDH)

Please read the problem carefully....

After that I think find the min value when N <= 60. This is because if we found 0~60 , after that adding 60 * ? will give all possble cases.

So, I do bfs 0~60 and add N%60 to the number of ADDH.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
