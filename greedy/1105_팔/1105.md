## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1105>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The situation that we must have to use 8 is that if the length of L and R are same and we cannot change digit number 

because they are same.

If we can change the number , the answer would be 0.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
