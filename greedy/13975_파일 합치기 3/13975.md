## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/13975>

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The first Number goes in keeps added before end.

So , we should add small number first and bigget number at last.

Jus becareful that the number range is up to 10000000000 so we have to use long long in priority_queue or vector.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
