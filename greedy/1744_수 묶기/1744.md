## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because multiplying bigger number as possilbe give bigger answer , sort and multiply in sequence.

However , N * 1 < N + 1 , so, we have to add all 1.

If the number is negative or zero, multiply negative numbers and add the last one.
