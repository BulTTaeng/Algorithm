# 19947_InvestmentGenius

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/19947

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Save the H value in dp[0] and find the max value in (dp[i-1]* 1.05 , dp[i-3] * 1.2 , dp[i-5] * 1.35).

Careful about the Index boundary out of range and double type calculation.

(When I tried it with filling up until dp[4] and calculate the maximum value of upper 3 values got failed. I don't know what is wrong with it...)

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
