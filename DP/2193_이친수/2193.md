## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2193

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we cannot put 1 after the binaray number end with 1, I thought there should be some pattern.

I write down the possible cases.

1. 1

2. 10

3. 101
   
   100
   
4. 1010
   1001
   1000
   
After these sequence I found that adding 01 after (i-2) and add 0 after (i-1) will make all possible cases for (i).
