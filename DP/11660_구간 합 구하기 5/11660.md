# 11660_SectionSum5

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11660

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

First , find the section sum starting from (1,1) to (n,n).

Then finding (x1,x2) (y1,y1) will be dp[y1][y2]( 1,1 to n,n) - dp[y1][x2-1](1,1 to y1,x2-1) -dp[x1-1][y2](1,1 to x1-1,y2) + dp[x1-1][x2-1] ( 1,1 to x1-1,x2-1 , this section is minused twice so we have to add it).

The upper equation can be explained by picture like below.

I learn something here. 'endl' takes so so so so manytimes...

I will never use endl again... 

하하하하하하하 endl 때문에 몇시간을 잡아 먹은건지 하하ㅏㅎ하ㅏ하ㅏ하ㅏ하....ㅠ

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
