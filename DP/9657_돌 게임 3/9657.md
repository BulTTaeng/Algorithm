# 9657_StoneGame3

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/9657

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If cases dp[i-1] dp[i-3] dp[i-4] SK all wins, That means whatever SK takes , the game will be same with i-1 or i-3 or i-4 stone game CY takes first turn.

Then CY can win the game.

If there is one or more cases that CY can win in dp[i-1] dp[i-3] dp[i-4], SK will take stones 1, 3 or 4 and change the game i-1, i-3 , i-5 stone game CY takes first turn.

So, SK can win if SK make that situation.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
