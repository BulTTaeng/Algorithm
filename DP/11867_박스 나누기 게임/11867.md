# 11867_BoxDividingGame

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11867

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming & heuristics

## What was the key point and the hard part?

By writting down the possible case, if there are 2 stones in one of the boxes, I notice that A will win.

In case of there are 4 stones in one of the boxes , by dividing 3 1 , A can win.

In this manner, I notice that if there is even number , A will win.

In sight of dp, we can see that n can be divided in to (1, n-1) , (2 , n-2) ...

So if all this cases , A can win, B can win because is is game with (k , n-k) which B take the first turn.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
