made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/9084

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Same problem that I solved. Only difference is that there are some test cases.

It is like knapsack problem with infinite items.

First count the all possible cases with the first coin.

Then update the dp array by adding possible cases with next coin.

Becareful with we have to fill it up with samll coin first.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
