## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2502

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Lets say that dp[1] = x , dp[2] = y

then 

dp[3] = x + y

dp[4] = x + 2y

dp[5] = 2x + 3y

we can see that the coefficient of x y is fibonnacci.

After finding the coefficient until D, search from ( 1, 1) to (k, k) and break.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
