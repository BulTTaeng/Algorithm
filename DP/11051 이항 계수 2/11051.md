## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11051 

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first, I though find factorial and MOD 10007 will work. But , I Failed.

After that I notice that (a/b) % MOD != ( (a) MOD / (b) MOD ) MOD.

This is because if a>b , a is bigger than MOD nd b is smaller , the answer will be under 1 eventhough the answer is not.

So, I tried to find the equation. There is a equation that is called Pascal's theorem.

nCk = (n-1)C(k-1) + (n-1)Ck

After that , I use dp and found the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
