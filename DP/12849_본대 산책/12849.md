## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/12849

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

After i minutes, check where can person would be.

After that , after one minute (i+1) find the near places , and add all it. 

For example, if person is in the 전산관 after i minute, that person can go to 정보과학관, 미래관, 신앙관.

So, add the possible way until person reach 전산관 to 정보과학관 미래관 신앙관.

In additional, I think I can use sliding window here. 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
