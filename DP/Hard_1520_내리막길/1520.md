# Hard_1520_Downhill

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1520

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs , dp

## What was the key point and the hard part?

It is always hard to use dp and graph algorithm both.

We will make all visit array -1 to check it is not visited or there is no way to reach (N-1, M-1)

If we reach (N-1 , M-1) return 1. This mean we found the way to reach (N-1 , M-1).

In receiving part, will will add (x-1,y) , (x+1, y ) , (x , y-1) (x , y+1) possible way to reach (N-1, M-1).

If that location already found possible way to reach (N-1 , M-1) via that location, just return possilbe way.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
