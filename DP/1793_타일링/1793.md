# 1793_Tiling

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Little bit weird problem.

As we can see in the problem, the number is very high it exceed the limit of long long.

So, I save each digit of the number (123 -> 1 2 3).

Apply the equation(dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] * 2 , this is because adding 2 * 1 tile to i-1 and adding one 2 * 2 tile or two 2 * 1 tiles to i-2 is i ) to each digit and if it is bigger than 10, add 1 to the next digit location.

Then showing the number from the back (because I save 1 digit to dp[n][1] 10 digit to dp[n][2]), if it is zero , pass or if it is not , print it.

The reason why I said this problem is weird is because of 2 reason.

1793_wrong got failed. I don't know what is wrong with it. Maybe 1793_wrong show somethint to EOF.

dp[0] is 1 not 0. If tile is 2 * 0, it is obviouse that there is no possible way to fill it with 2 * 1 tile... But dp[0] = 0 got failed... It is little bit annoying...

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
