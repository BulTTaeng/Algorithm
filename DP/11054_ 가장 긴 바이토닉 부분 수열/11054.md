# "11054"

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11054

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I think there should be better solution rather than finding the length of maximum increasing sequence and add 1. (Like I solve 11053)

That takes O(N^2), but this takes only O(NlogN).

The reason why we subtract 1 to the ans is that the number is both used in increasing sequence and decreasing sequence.

Someone might have question that that number might not be used.
For example, 

1 5 2 1 4 3 4 5 2 1

Let's assume third 2 is the Sk in the problem. We might have 1 2 1 as answer.

However, We are looking for the longest sequence. It means Sk should be always used in increasing sequence and decreasing sequence. 

So, Sk will be always in both sequence.



## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
