## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15989

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar to problme that I solved. But like that time, I failed to solve it by my self.

Finding some possible cases when duplicate does not allowed, have similar algorithm.

If there is n options that I can take, starting from one option to n option , filling the dp will work.

In this problem, There is 3 option.

Adding 1

Adding 2

Adding 3

So lets start with 1. There is one possible way to fill it with only 1. (1+1+...+1). Add 1 to (i-1) will give you the answer.

Next, start with 2. There is (i-2) possible way to fill it with 1 and 2. 
Add 2 to (i-2) will give you the answer.

Because we only have 1 in all dp array, starting from 1st index to nth index will fill the dp in sequence.

Be aware that adding 2 cases should start from 2nd index because there is no possible way to make 1 with 2 and 1.

After that, (i-3) possible way to fill it with 1 and 2 and 3.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
