# 2624_ChangeCoins

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2624

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Starting from the small coin, fill up the dp array. dp[i][j] += 1 when it is possible to make it.

After that , starting from the start, search all dp array and if it is not zero, add that possible cases to dp[current location + current coins value * current coins's number(one to n).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
