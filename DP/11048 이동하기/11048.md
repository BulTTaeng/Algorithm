## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11048

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Typical dp problem.

We have 3 choices to take right, down , right below.

Calculate all this value and compare it with the max value which we will save it in a dp array.

If value in dp( this is calculated before) is bigger, keep it. If the value (max value in current location + value(candy) in the location we are heading) is bigger than the dp value we are heading, save former value.

By keep updating the value until N-1 , M-1, the biggest value will be saved in dp[N-1][M-1]!

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
