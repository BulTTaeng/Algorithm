## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1106

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

First , be aware that customer's number does not have to be exactly C. (more or equal to C is possible.)

This algorithm is like knapsack problem. But because customer's number does not have to be exactly C, we have to do additional thing.

if(j < cus[i]) dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] , cost[i]);

This code is for that purpose(ans >= C). 

For example, if there is a input like below,

10 2

1 5

20 1

In this case, making customer == C is 50. However, making customer > C is 1 because we can take second option.

So, we have to check the cost of current checking option and min cost until now and find the min.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
