## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15312

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

First, save the number (획수) in the dp[0] location. Be sure to save A and B in turns.

After that , adding and save the % 10 value of the dp[i-1] values.

Because the length of the string is same and we have to make 2 numbers, the answer location would be length * 2 - 2. (The array starts with 0)

Be sure to print number seperatly!!!! I got failed when adding them in int value (dp[0] * 10 + dp[1]).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
