# 12852_MakeIt1_2

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/12852

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

In here I make another arrya pre and save the perviouse value which match the condition(smaller calculation time).

After that by using recursive function, print value in sequence. 

Careful that we have to set pre = 1 for number 1 for end of recursion.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
