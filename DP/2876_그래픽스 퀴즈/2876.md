## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Understanding the question was much harder than solve it.

The sentence

오늘 교수님은 바쁜 나머지 한 가지 색의 색연필만 가지고 왔고, 결국 자신의 미학을 지키기 위해 퀴즈에서 지목한 모두에게 같은 그레이드를 주려고 한다. 

means that professor will give the score if the student's score is same with the score I want to give today.

Also, professor select the i to j table, So if one of the table between i and j does not have a score that professor decided to give , It is impossible case.

For example, let's assume professor decided to give score 1, 

1 3

5 4

1 3

In this case , the answer is 1 1 because there is no 1 in second table, so professor have to select (1 to 1) table or (3 to 3) table.

Solving it will be just making array filled with zero and checking what number had appear and add 1 to the previouse location. 

Becareful to check grade either because professor want the minimum grade.

(I think this professor is little bit weird ....)
