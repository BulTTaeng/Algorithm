## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17218>

## What Algorithm should I use?

LCS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Just use LCS(S is subsequnce) and print it.

Because the problem state that there is only one LCS, we don't have to check other possible cases.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
