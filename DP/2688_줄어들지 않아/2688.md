# 2688_DoesNotDecrease

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2688

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Same problem that I solved.

By checking the end digit number of each number will work.

If end digit number is 0, there are 10 options that we can make.(adding 0 ~ 9)

If end digit number is 1, there are 9 options that we can make.(1 ~ 9)

.

.

.

If end digit number is 9, there is only 1 options that we can make. (1)

So, end digit[0] will be always 1 and end digit[9] will be adding [0] ~ [9].

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
