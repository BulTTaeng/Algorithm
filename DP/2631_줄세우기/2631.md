# 2631_LineUp

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2631  

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I solve it with some guesses.

We have to move child if she or he is not in the correct location.

To make least moves, we should not move children in LIS.

Except for them, child have to move.

Child in the LIS does not have to move because we can put other children between, back, front of LIS children.

So, answer would be N - LIS.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
