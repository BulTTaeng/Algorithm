## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/7579>

## What Algorithm should I use?

DP ,knapsack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , I tried with two pointer. 

However, we cannot choose start and end.

Brute-force time complexity is O(2^100) , so It is absolutly TLE.

So, I see the category in the problem.

At first , I think I should make dp[number of item][Memory].

But this will cost 100 * 10000000. So, It will not work.

I change to dp[number of item][cost] and save the max memory I can get with the cost.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
