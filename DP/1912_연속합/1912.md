## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Think that there will be 2 options if I see minus number, so I tried to save the large value in a variable.
However, the large value will always in the dp array, which means that there is no reason to save it.

After that just saving the added value until now and if the previous value is smaller than 0, just save the current value in the dp array.
finally, scan all the dp array and find the max variable

Forget to check 0.... After checking 0, it works.
