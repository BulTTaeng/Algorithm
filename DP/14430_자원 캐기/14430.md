## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14430

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar to the problem that I solve, (I don't remember... It was english problem and it is like someone walking the stage?...)

Because there is only two option (from left , from top) , only thing we have to do is find the max value of previouse step.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
