# 5582_LongestCommonString

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/5582

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I thought this is Longest Common Sequence problem that I solved. But this is Longest Common String problem.

In here, if str1[i] != str2[j] then make that dp zero because it have to be continuous.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
