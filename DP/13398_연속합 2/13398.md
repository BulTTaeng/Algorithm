## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

My problem was I think I have to consider when inp is minus.

Even though that is true, there is more simple thing.

Finding out taking out of current value or not taking out current value can work.

dp_1 is for saving the max value if we taken out one value.

dp_1[i] = max(dp_1[i-1] + inp[i], dp[i-1]);

dp_1[i-1] + inp[i] is saying that we are not going taken out current value.  Because dp_1 is saving the max value of taking one value of the array, dp_1[i-1] is a max value that we already taken one value out of the array.

dp[i-1] means max value until current value. This means we are going to taken out current value. So, if we save dp_1[i-1] , we are taking out 2 values which means it is out of condition. That is the reason we are saving dp[i-1] not dp_1[i-1].

My pain was focusing on the tree not looking at the forest.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
