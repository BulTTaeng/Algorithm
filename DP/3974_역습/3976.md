# 3976_CounterAttack

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3976 

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

In every step, there is 2 possible case.

1. striker 1 has the ball

2. striker 2 has the ball 

And there is 2 options for strikers except for start and end.

1. pass

2. dribble

So, keep checkint the min value of (I have ball in previous step + dribble , I don't have a ball + I got pass) will be the minimum cost of s1 or s2 have the ball in current step.

Adding the first pass from defender and shooting will give you the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
