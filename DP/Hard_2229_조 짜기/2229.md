## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

*Failed to solve it by myself"

Things getting much harder...

In here, there is 2 option when you meet the next number.

1. add it in another group

2. do not add it in another group. Make it one group with it self.

Case 2 will be same as dp[i-1] because (number) group has (number - number = 0) point

In case 1, there is possibility to group it with (i-1 , i) or (i-2 , i-1 , i) or (i-3 , i-2 , i) .... (1 , 2 , 3, ... i).

So, starting from i(current location) to 1, find the max and min value(other values does not affect score) and add it with dp[j-1] value.

For example, at first, 

(number - number = 0) + dp[i-1] (case 2)

(max - min) + dp[i-2] (grouping (1 , 2, ... ,i-2) (i-1 , i)

Like this.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
