# 1788_ExpansionOfFibonacci

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If n is bigger than 0, there is no problem. Just use fibonacci.

But if n is smaller than 0, It is problem.

I think I want to use array staring with 0 and save the fibonacci value in dp[abs(i)] location, I have to change the equation.

Fibonacci equation is like this.

f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

But if n is negative number, taking the abs of it will make abs(n-2) > abs(n-1) > abs(n).

f(n-2)  = f(n) - f(n-1)

change n to n + 2.

f(n) = f(n+2) - f(n+1)

In here n is negative, so the abs of n+2 will be same with abs(n)-2 and abs of n+1 will be same with abs(n) - 1.

f(n) = f(n-2) - f(n-1)

This is a equation for negative fibonacci to save it in a positive index array.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
