# 15486_QuitJob2

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15486

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The algorithm that I used is same with 퇴사 problem that I solved.

Starting from the end, check if it is possible to do that interview (ex) we can not do inteview if I quit job at 7th day but 6th day's interview takes 5 days).

If we can do interview, check the max value after days need to to that interview and add the current interview's pay.

Compare it with if I did not take that interview , which is saved in the (i+1) location.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
