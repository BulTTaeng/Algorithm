# 14606_Pizza_Small

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14606

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

When seperate some number and find the maximum multiplication value of seperated number, seperated numbers should be similar as possible.

When seprating 5 pizza, to make maximun multiplication value, I have to divide it in to 2 and 3. 

In this case the score will be 3 * 2 = 6.

After that, we can think that dividing 3 and 2 and find maximum value is same with 3 pizza and 2 pizza problem.

So, the answer would be seperated number1 * seperated number2 + dp[seperated number1] + dp[seperated number2].

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
