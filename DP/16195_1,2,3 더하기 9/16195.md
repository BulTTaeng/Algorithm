## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

To make k-length case, there is 3 options.

1. Adding 3 to (i-3) which (i-3)'s length is (k-1)

2. Adding 2 to (i-2) which (i-2)'s length is (k-1)

3. Adding 1 to (i-1) which (i-1)'s length is (k-1)

So we should save the nubmer we want to make and the length of cases.

           
      number        lenngth of cases  

                           1 2 3 4 

        1                  1  

        2                  1 1
        
        3                  1 2 1
        
        4                    3 3 1
        
 So, we found the equation dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-2][j-1] + dp[i-3][j-1]) in common.
 
 To make it more nice code, (k,k) would be always 1 because there is only one option(3= 1+1+1)
