## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Let's assume we have n coins and each coin's value is saved in coins array.

Making k can be rewrite in this way.

k = adding coins[0] to (k-coins[0])

    adding coins[1] to (k-coins[1])
    
    .
    .
    .
    
    adding coins[n] to (k-coins[n])

However, keep adding them make dumplicates.
For example, with 1,2,5 coins making 4 is 1111, 112, 22. Making 3 is 111, 12 making 2 is 11, 2
Adding 2 to making 2 case is 112, 22 and adding 1 to making 3 case is 1111, 112, so we have 112 duplicates.

To avoid this situation, we update all dp with smallest coin(coins[0]) and coins[1] ... and so on.

By doing that we can have 

value 1 2  3   4

      1 11 111 1111

with coins[0] (1) first and then

value 1 2    3      4

      1 11,2 111,12 1111, 112, 22

with coins[1] (2) and so on.

We cannot add 5 coin to make value less then 5, so updating coins[i] to k will work.
