## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11722

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I can use O(N^2) algorithm but I have better solution to solve it by O(N*NlogN).

Almost same with the problem 11054 that I solved.

Only thing I have to do is make decrasing array not increasing array.
