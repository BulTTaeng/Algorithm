# 14226_Emoticon

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14226

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we have to find min time, we can think BFS will work for this problem.

Lets say that visit[the number of emoji on the screen] [ the number of emoji in the clipboard].

There is 3 option in this problem, so set the 3 options and put it in a queue and if the number matches with N, stop searching.

Be careful to chekc the range before see the vistit array.

*Brute - force also work!*

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
