# 17291_CreatureBreeding

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17291

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming && implementation

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Implementation.

make n * n array. row will be the born of the creature and col will be the year.

At (k,k) point , the number of creature born  = all creature in the previous year * 2.

At (a(a<k) , k) point, check the (a-3) year, (a-3) %2 == 1 and (a-4) year , (a-4) % 2 == 0. If it does, make it zero.

DP

Notice that the number of creature born  = all creature in the previous year * 2.

So, the number of new born creature in i th year = the number of creature in (i-1) year.

Also, odd + 3 = even , even + 4 == even. That means we have to check when i is even. 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
