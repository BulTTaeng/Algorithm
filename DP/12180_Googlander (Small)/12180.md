## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/12180

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

It was pretty hard to find the answer first time. 

I saw the hint(3 * 3) in the webpage. I see that some patterns are from smaller (2 * 3 , 2 * 2, 3 * 2) situation.

I write down the possible cases. if R or C is 1 then the answer will be always 1.

In case of 2 * 2, there is 2 possible cases.

In herem I notice that adding one case to the (i-1) (R,2)  , (j-1) (2, C) is the answer.

Also, I know the answer of 3 * 3 case.

I tried to find some patterns in this array and I notice that dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1] = dp[i][j].

I tried it and I got a answer.

I think this problem gives me an lesson that if it is hard to find the answer, just write down possible cases.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
