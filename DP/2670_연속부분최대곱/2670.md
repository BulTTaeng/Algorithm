# 2670_ContinuousMaxMultiplication

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2670

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If (max multiplication value until now) * current value is less than current value, it is decrease when we multiply it.

So, in that case, we will restart multiplication from now on(current value).

By doing this, we can keep the biggest value to multiply at this monent.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
