## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming (recurrence relation)

## What was the key point and the hard part?
 
The numbers that I can use is just 1, 2 and 3, so I think about that the number 'n' can be made from (n-3+3) , (n-2+2) , (n-1+1). 

I write down the possible cases, and then I notice that there is a pattern.
