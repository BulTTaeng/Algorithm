# 14494_WhatIsDP

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14494

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar to the problem that I solved (previouse repository).

If movement is limited as in the problem(down , right, down right) for loop can check all possible cases.

So, just adding (previouse location's possible path + current location's possible path) will work.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
