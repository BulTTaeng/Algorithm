## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Just count the number if the current number is smaller than previous one or current number is bigger than previouse one.

If not, reset the dp[i] to 1.

After that , find the max value.
