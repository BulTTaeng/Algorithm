# 2780_Password

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2780

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Be aware that 11 , 22 , ... 00 is not possible in this problem.

By checking the end number of password, we can count the next possible cases.

If there is 3 password end with 7 , (length+1)'s password end with 0 will be 3 because 0 can be only added to the password end with 7.

Likewise, dp[1][i] = (dp[2][i-1] + dp[4][i-1]) % MOD; dp[2][i] = (dp[1][i-1] + dp[3][i-1] + dp[5][i-1]) % MOD; ...

At the end, adding dp[0][inp] to dp[9][inp] and % MOD will be the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
