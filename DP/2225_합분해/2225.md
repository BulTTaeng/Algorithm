# 2225_Decomposition

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2225

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

It does not take long to solve it but understanding why takes some time.

x + ? = N

in here x + ? 's length is K. The length of x is k-1.

? is just one number. ? could be 0 ~ N.

This means k-1 's locations all value until N can be the answer.

Let me show you example.

N =2 , K =4

n       k

/       1   2   3   4
        
0       1   1   1   1 

1       1

2       1


In here makeing 0 with K number is always 1 (1 = 0 , 2 = 0 + 0 , 3 = 0 + 0 + 0...)
Making N with 1 number is always 1 ( 1= 1 , 2 = 2 ...)

n       k

/       1   2   3   4
        
0       1   1   1   1 

1       1   2

2       1

making 1 with 2 number is (0,1) (1,0). This is dp[0][1] + dp[1][1]. This can be explained with (dp[0][1] = 0 , dp[1][1] = 1 ,  dp[0][1] + 1 = (0,1), dp[1][0] + 0 = (1,0) )

So we can see that adding all values in K-1 until N will be the answer.

If we use this algorithm, we have to use 3 loops , but we are keep summing up the values until N-1 in the dp[N-1][K], dp[N-1] + dp[N][K-1] will give you the answer.

This can solve this problem with 2 loops.
