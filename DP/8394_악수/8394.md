made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/8394

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

There is 2 case when new person sits.

Case 1 new person does not gives a handshake.

This case is same with dp[i-1] case.

Case 2 new person gives a handshake.

In this case , a person who is sitting next to new person cannot gives a handshake and new person cannot gives a handshake.

This means there is 2 person who cannot gives a handshake.

This case is same with dp[i-2] case.

Therefore , this problem have same equation with fibonacci.
