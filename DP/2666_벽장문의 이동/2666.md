# 2666_MovingClosetDoor

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We cannot know moving first door or second door will small in the future.

For example, we have to open 4 and 6 and now opened closet door is 2 and 6.

To open 4, it does not matter because it cost same moves. However, if we move 6 to 4, we have to move 4 -> 6 so, moving 2 at first is better choice.

Because the number of closet is not so big, I save all possible cases in the dp.

dp[opened closet1][opened closet2][moves that we make] is meaning of dimension in the dp and keep saving 

dp[next location][opened closet2][moves that we make] += abs(next location - opened closet1)

dp[opened closet1][next location][moves that we make] += abs(next location - opened closet2)

will work.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
