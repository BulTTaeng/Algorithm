# 15990_Adding1-2-3_5

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15990

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we cannot add 1 after 1 2 after 2 3 after 3, we have to check the last number of dp[i-1] , dp[i-2] , dp[i-3].

Adding 3 to dp[i-3] which ends with 1 and 2 

Adding 2 to dp[i-2] which ends with 1 and 3 

Adding 1 to dp[i-1] which ends with 2 and 3

is the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
