made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/9625

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because A will be change in to B, previous number of A will be added to current B number.

In the same manner, B becomes BA , previous number of B will be added to curretn B and A number.

I use sliding window to save the space complexity.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
