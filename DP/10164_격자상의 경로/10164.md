# 10164_PathInGrid

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/10164 

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If robot have to pass specific location, we can divide the problem in to 2 part.

1. Starting from (1,1) to specific location.

2. Starting from specific location to (N,M)

Multiplying part 1 and part 2 will give you the answer.

How to find the possible way can be solved with dp.

Save the possible ways to reach current location in the dp[i][j]. Robot can go down or right. Possible way to reach down location though current location will be same as 
possible ways to reach current location. Adding dp[i][j] to dp[i+1][j] and dp[i][j+1] will give you the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
