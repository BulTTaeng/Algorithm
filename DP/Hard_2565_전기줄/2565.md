# Hard_2565_ElectronicWire

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2565

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

This is extension of increasing sequence.

Finding out min wire to get rid of wires is same with finding max wires we can build.

Let's say x is first electronic pole and y is second electronic pole's location.

If x is sorted in increasing sequence and y is bigger than previous wire's y location, we can build that wire.

So, after sorting x, find out max increasing sequence in y will give you max wires we can build.

n - max wires we can build will be the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
