# 2011_SecretCode

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2011

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was I miss understand the logic. 

I though dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] when if 26 >= inp[i-1] * 10 + inp[i] >=10 except for inp[i] == 0.

However if inp[i] ==0 in that range, dp[i] = dp[i-2].

This is because if zero appear, we cannot use (i-1) , (i) seperatly.

For example 11 can become AA or K, but 110 should be only AJ.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
