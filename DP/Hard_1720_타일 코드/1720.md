## What was the key point and the hard part?

*Failed to solve it by myself*

There is many hard problems...

dp equation is same with 2 * 1 tile problem( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] * 2)

In here we have to consider left-right symmetry tiles. 

If tile is left-right symmetry, we don't have to consider it beacause if we reverse it, it is same shape tile.

If tile is not left-right symmetry, we have to divide it with 2 because they are duplicates.

So, how to find the left-right symmetry?

If n is odd, 2 * 1 tile in the middle should be left-right symmetry. So half of n without 2 * 1 tile will be left-right symmetry tiles. (n-1)/2

If n is even, 2 * 2 , two of 1 * 2 tile in the middle should be left-right symmetry. So half without it will be left-right symmetry tilese . ( (n-2 / 2)th tiles * 2 (2 * 2 or two 1 * 2))

In addition half of even tile will be left-right symmetry. So half wil be left-right symmetry tiles. ( n/2)

We found the left-right symmetry tiles, and now subtract the non- left-right symmetry tils to dp[n].

The equation is like below.

  if(n%2 == 0)
  
   dp[n] = dp[n] - ( (dp[n] - (dp[n/2] + dp[(n-2) /2]*2 )) /2 );
  
  
  
  else
  
   dp[n] = dp[n] - ( (dp[n] - ( dp[(n-1) / 2] ) ) / 2);
