# 16500_StringDetermination

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16500 

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

First , sort input string (A) in alphabet sequence. String starts with 'a' will be put in a [0] location and z will be put in a [25] location.

Then starting from the Target String's first char, compare it with string(A) which starts with Target[0].

Compare those two, and if it is same until the length of string(a), push next start location in to a queue.

If starting location had already inserted before, (use visit array) do not push it because we already calculated that situation.

If we found the answer, stop and return the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
