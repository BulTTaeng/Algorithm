## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part and key point was to find out that as N increase by 2 , 2 more possible cases appear.

At 3 * 4, The new 2 possible cases appear.

We can see that using 2 * 1 tile between 2 and 3 , will make new tiles that can fill 3 * 4. 
This is because by only using 3 * 2 tiles combination, 2 and 3 should be seperated.

In the same manner, by using 2 * 1 tile between 3 and 4 will make 2 new cases in filling 3 * 6.

So, the possible cases will be like this.

3 * 2 = 3 (there is 3 possilbe cases to fill 3 * 2 wall , now call this 2_1 , 2_2 , 2_3)

3 * 4 = 2_? and 2_? ( 3 * 3 = 9 cases) + 2(Shown in the picture above, call this 4_1 , 4_2)

3 * 6 = 2_? and 2_? and 2_?(27) + 2_? and 4_? (6) + 4_? and 2_? (6) + 2(call this 6_1, 6_2)

.

.

.

Now, we can see that adding 4_? to the (i-4) case + adding 2_? to the (i-2) case + 2 is the answer.

In 3 * 8 case, adding 6_? to the (i-6) case + adding 4_? to the (i-4) case + adding 2_? to the (i-2) case + 2 is the answer.

So, we find the solution that 

3 * N case = adding (N-2)_? to the (i-2) case + adding (N-4)_? to the (i-4) case + ....... + 2.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
