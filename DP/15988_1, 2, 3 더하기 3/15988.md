# 15988_Adding1-2-3_3

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15988

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Number n can be maded from n-1 + 1 , n-2 + 2, n-3 + 3.

Becareful about the MOD, because MOD is 1,000,000,009, adding dp[n-1] + dp[n-2] + dp[n-3] can exceed the range fo int!

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
