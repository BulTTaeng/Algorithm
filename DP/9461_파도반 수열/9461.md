## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/9461

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

After understanding the question, I draw some of the sequences.

I notice some rules after that.

1. previous triangle's leg length is added.

2. (i-5) triangle's leg length is added. 

There is some exception in second rule in the beginning, but there is no problem because the leg of triangle is same.
