## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/5430>

## What Algorithm should I use?

String  , implementation , deque.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because if the input is full of R, this will cause TLE.

So, I use deque to use pop_back , pop_front.

Check the deque is reversed or not, and at last, if it is reversed, reverse it at the end and print it.

The hard part was that we cannot use reverse all the time we get 'R' and the number of input more than 2 digit numbers should be added first and 
add the the deque.

Like an example input, if there is 42 as the input number , we should add 4 and 2 to the string first and push to the deque.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
