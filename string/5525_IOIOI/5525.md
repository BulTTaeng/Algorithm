## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/5525>

## What Algorithm should I use?

String

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we have IOI , it means we have possibility of finding Pn pattern.

while increasing i by 2 , we can check IOI to find out if we find longer patter(ex, IOIOI)

If we reached to Pn pattern , increase the answer 1 and if we find IOI one more time , it means we can count it as new one.

If we can't find the pattern IOI , increase i by 1 and do the same thing.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
