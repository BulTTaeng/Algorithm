## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/12904>

## What Algorithm should I use?

String , greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The idea was hard.

We have to make input string to target string.

= target string to input string.

We only have 2 options. Both 2 options is pop_back

If last word of target string is 'B' we have to reverse the target string.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
