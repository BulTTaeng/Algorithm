## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1701>

## What Algorithm should I use?

KMP

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I think I have to study more about KMP algorithm. 

As soon as I see the problem , I notice that it is a KMP but I cannot think that table of KMP only check longest comm substring starting with 

firtr char of string.

After searching I noticed that I have to check substr((0~length) , length).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
