## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16120>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Stack , greedy

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We will make given string to P.

If there is PPAP in given string , it can be change to P.

To find PPAP we will gonna use stack.

P can goes in to stack except for,

1. stack's top is A.

If stack's top is A , it means we found PPAP , so we have to pop 2 times to just leave P.

A can goes in to stack except for,

1. stack size is less than 2 (which means there is 0 or 1 P in the stack -> NP)

2. stack's top is 'A'.


So, at the end , we have to check stack's size and stack's top.

If stack size is 1 and stack's top is 'P' , it is PPAP.

Otherwise , it's not.
