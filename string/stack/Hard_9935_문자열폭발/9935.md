## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/9935>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was that I fotgot to check bomb[0] should be saved in the stack any way.

For example , if input is 

C4C455

C45

the answer should be FRULA.

However , I miss tha case that 'C' can goes inside of stack when we have '4' or '5'.

Except for that , I use stack to solve this.

If we did not found anything then I push if I found bomb[0].

If I found bomb[0] , I push bomb[0] and bomb[next]. Otherwise , I clear the stack and set point to -1 so that we can know we did not find anything.

When we found bomb, I use del array to check that location char in the string is exploded.


I found the better solution in the internet.

Just use one string to add string, if string[i] is same with end of bomb, search answer and if all matches , 

pop_back (bomb.length) times.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
