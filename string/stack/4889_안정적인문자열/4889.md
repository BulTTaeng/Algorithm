## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/4889>

## What Algorithm should I use?

String , Stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

{ can go in to the stack because we can delete it later.

} cannot go in to the stack and pop stack if stack is not empty.

If stack is empty, it means we have to change it to { to make a pair.

After these sequence is done, the stack will have even number of { and we should change one of them to }.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
