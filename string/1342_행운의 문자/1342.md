## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1342>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Back tracking , brute force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because the length of string is very small(10) I think brute force will work.

Save the number of each alphabet and do backtracking.

Starts with the string "".

Search all alphabet and if it is possible to add to the end of string, add it.

If the string reaches to the length of input strnig. return 1 and add it to the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
