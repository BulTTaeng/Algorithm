## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/7490>

## What Algorithm should I use?

완전 탐색 , brute-force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was find out the calculation of " ".

The problem is that we cannot update immediately if there is " " operator.

We have to save the next update value in the parameter and update if

1. when we meet + or - operator

2. when we reach to the end.

Also, we have to save the prev operator to find out we have to subtract it or add it.
