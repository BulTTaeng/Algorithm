## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

TRIE

## What was the key point and the hard part?

This is my first time to see TRIE algorithm.

TRIE is to search(find) string more faster.

The structure is like an Tree.

We make Root first and make 10(0~9) Nodes below root.

When we first meet some number , we create node and insert it.

Save if inserting string is end.

After we done with inserting , while we are searching some string and if we meet end sign in the middle, that means it is does not have consistency.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
