왜 맞 틀 ! 을 시전해 버렸다...

The problem is that we cannot catch overtaking cars just by comparing the order.

For example,

A                   A

B                   C

D                   D

C                   B

The answer is 2 (C,D) but just comparing the order , we cannot catch D because in order and out order is same.

So we have to save the in number and outnumber and find the car that arrives faster than previouse car.

A 1                   A 1

B 2                   C 4

D 3                   D 3

C 4                   B 2

C arrives fater than D,B and D arrives faster  than B so C,D is the answer
