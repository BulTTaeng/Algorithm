## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1958>

## What Algorithm should I use?

DP, String

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have new string here compare to LCS2.

So, we need 3D array to solve this.

check all char is same. If it is same dp[i][j][k] will be dp[i-1][j-1][k-1]+1.

else dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i][j][k-1] , dp[i][j-1][k] . dp[i-1][j][k])

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
