## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1254>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Brute - force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we are adding the char at the end of string , if there is a palindrome in the (? ~ end) we can use it.

So, we have to find the palindrome at the end.

Starting from 0 to end , find the location of palindrome starts.

The location + length of input string is the answer because we have to add non-palindrome part to end of palindrome part. 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
