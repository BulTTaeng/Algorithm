## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/12919>

## What Algorithm should I use?

String , bfs , brute-force

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The length of input string and target string are 49 and 50.

So, I think searching all cases might work.

There is some conditions we have to check.

1. end of target string is B

In this case , if the front of target is A, then we cannot erase more.

Else , if the front of target is B , we can reverse and pop_back.

2. end of target string is A

In this case , we can just pop_back or 
If the front of target is B , we can reverse and pop_back().

push all cases in the queue and check the length of str and target.

If target becomes shorter than str , that is impossible case.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
