## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2493>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because only we need to do is find the longer tower in front of current tower, I use stack to solve this.

Save {height , index} in the stack and if we found longer tower, pop until we found longer tower in the stack.

Poped tower will received by longer tower, so save it in the array.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
