## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/4195>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Union-Find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was 

1. If two person is already friend, just pass
2. We have to make a standard of root while doing Union find.

Because we are doing Union-find while getting the input, we might add the group number to a, then next time we add to b 
even though they are same group.

So, we have to make a standard(ex , smaller one)

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
