## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1874>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , I check all possible cases.

If the stack.top() < v[iter] < next push number , It means it is impossible.

I got passed with 1874_long.cpp code , but I think about another cases.

1874_short is using that I can only pop when s.top() == v[iter].

When I finish, If I reach the end of input.size+1, I means I succesfully pop out every value.

Else, I failed.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
