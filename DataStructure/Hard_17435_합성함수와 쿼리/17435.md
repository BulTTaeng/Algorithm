## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17435>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Sparse array

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I cannot search all the way because I O(200000 * 500000)  will absolutly TLE.

I have to use sparse array so that I can search it in O(MlogQ).

The power of 2 can present all numbers because it contains 1.

So, rather than searching 1+1+1+1+1+ ... +1 = 12, I search 8+4 = 12.

Because 2^(i-1) * 2^(i-1) = 2^i, I will save the next destination in dp[start node][i] with dp[ dp[start_Node][i-1] ][i-1].

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
