## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14427>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Sorting , priority_queue

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Just use pq to save the min number and index.

If saved value in index does not matches to the value in pq, pop.

If not, print it.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
