## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2841>

## What Algorithm should I use?

priority_queue or stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

By using priority queue , we can check the max pratt pressed and highest pratt per line.

If the top pratt is less than current pratt , just push.

If same, leave it.

If bigger , pop until we found smaller pratt.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
