## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1517>

## What Algorithm should I use?

MergeSort

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because O(N^2) will give TLE , we have to find another solution.

Use merge sort to sort and count the distance between chaing index.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
