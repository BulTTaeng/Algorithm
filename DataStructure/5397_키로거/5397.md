## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/5397>

## What Algorithm should I use?

list or stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We can use stack or list to solve this.

list

Just check the location of the iterator and do insert and erase

stack.

We will use 2 stack. 

First stack's top is the location of the iterator.

Second stack saves the char after iterator.
