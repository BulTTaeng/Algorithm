## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17299>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The problem is that NGF[2] means not number 2  index 2.

For example we cannot put number inside of stack. If we do that NGF[i] means number i's 오등큰수 not i index's 오등쿤수.

Except for that , just save the less appeared number in the stack and if we find bigger one, save to index and pop. 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
