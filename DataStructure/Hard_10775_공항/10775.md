## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

Union-Find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

It was suprised that I can use Union-find here.

If we set the root number < number while doing Union, we can find which place is empty by Find.

If Find = 0 , it means it is out of range or ther is no space left.

(gi is connected to gi-1, if gi-1 is occupied , Find(gi) will give you next occupied location , so we dock airplane in Find(gi) -1)

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
