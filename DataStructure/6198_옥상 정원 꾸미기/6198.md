## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/6198>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Stack

## What was the key point and the hard part?

save the height and (the number of rooftop that I can see) in the stack.

If we cannot see some rooftop , then we cannot see next rooftop.

Starting from the last tower, I save the longer tower in the stack and save the tower that it can see.

When though we poped some tower , if more heigher tower appears , that tower should see shorter tower.

So, I add answer and temp both.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
