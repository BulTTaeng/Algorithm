## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11000>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Priority_queue

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we have to do all lecture , we save the endtime of each lecture in the pq.

Sort the input in increasing order and if there is some lecture ends before next lecture starts, use that lecture room.

If not use another room (push).

The lecture room's number is same with endtime priority_queue in the end.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
