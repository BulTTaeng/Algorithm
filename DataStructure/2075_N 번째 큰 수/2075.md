## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2075>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Priority queue

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we only have 12MB memory, we cannot get all input and sort.

So, I use priority queue to just save N big numbers.

Be aware that we have to use long long type.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
