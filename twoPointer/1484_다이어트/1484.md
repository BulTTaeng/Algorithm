## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1484>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Two pointer 

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Before solving this , we should know that there is no person with 0 kg weight.

Also, G is Natural number , 0 cannot be G.

So, starting from current weight = 2 and previouse weight = 1 will work in this.

If the diffrence between them is same with G, there is no possible case to make G with current weight.

So, increase the current weight after saving it.

If diff < G , increase current weight , diff > G increase the previouse weight.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
