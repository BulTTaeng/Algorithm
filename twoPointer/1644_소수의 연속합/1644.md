## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1644>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Two pointer

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we know we only consider continuous sequence of prime number and we have to find sum of them, we can use two-pointer.

If sum is smaller than N, add next prime number. If sum is bigger than N, subtract the samllest prime number.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
