## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1644>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Two pointer

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we know we only consider continuous sequence of prime number and we have to find sum of them, we can use two-pointer.

If sum is smaller than N, add next prime number. If sum is bigger than N, subtract the samllest prime number.

If N is prime number , We will miss the last case (myself).

So, I add the dummy value in the vector.

This can be alse solved by adding 1 to the answer if the N is prime.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
