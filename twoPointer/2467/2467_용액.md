## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2467>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Two pointer.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We will start with (0,N-1) which means (start , end).

We cannot select same solution so we will repeat it until (start < end) and (end>=0).

If the diff is positive number,  decrase the end. If the abs(diff) is smaller than saved value, save the location of start and end.

If the diff is negative number , increase the start. If the abs(diff) is smaller than saved value, save the location of start and end.

If the diff is zero , which is optimal case , save the location of start and end and print it.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
