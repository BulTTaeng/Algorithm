## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1253>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Two pointer

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The problem is we cannot select (i,j) to make i or j.
(0 , 1) -> answer : 0

So, we will find out we can make number[i] with diffrent two number.

Sort the input number first. Because same number in different location is different number , we will do this (0 to N-1)

By doing two pointer algorithm , check we can make the target number with 2 different number except for target number.

If we can make it, answer++

The hard part was thinking that not finding the sum number , just finding the number[i] with two different number.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
