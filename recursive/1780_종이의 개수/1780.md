## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1780>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Divide and conquer

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I have to check 9 sector in this problem.

The divide case will be the number of sector is not equal to the first number in the sector.

If first number is not equal to one of the number in the sector, divide it in to 9 sector again and find the answer.

If all the numbers in the sector is same, according to the first number , add it to the answer (-1 or 0 or 1 ).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
