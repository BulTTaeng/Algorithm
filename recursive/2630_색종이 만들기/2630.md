## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2630>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Divide-and-conquer , recursive

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Search 4 section recursively.

We don't have to check all of the sections, because if the sum of inp is not same with iteration or zero, it means is is not only blue or white.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
