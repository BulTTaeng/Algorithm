## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2448>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Recursive

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I have some problem with printing it. I have to print 0 to N* 2 -1 not N*2;

If we know the size of triangle and the one of the vertex, we can catch the location of traingle.

So, by doing recursive function , I save the vertex loc and size.

If the size reaches 3 , I print the smallest traingle.
