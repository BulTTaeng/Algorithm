## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/4485

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dijkstra

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Just dijkstra using array not vector(adjacent).

If we can go to some location and the cost unitil now + next cost is smaller than previouse saved value, update and push in the priority queue.

The priority queue should be sorted in increasing sequence so we can get smaller edges first.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
