# 1504_SpecificShortestWay

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1504 

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dijkstra

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Do dijkstra (1 to N1) , (1 to N2)

and (N1 to N2) , (N2 to N1) , (N1 to N) , (N2 to N).

(N1 is first location that we have to visit and N2 is another location that we have to visit)

There is 2 option to reach N via N1 and N2.

1 -> N1 - > N2 -> N

1 -> N2 -> N1 -> N

Compute these two and find the min value.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
