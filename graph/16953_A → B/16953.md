# 16953_AtoB

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16953

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The key point is that 10^9 * 2 exceed the range of int.

So, I use long long type.

The next hard part was that if I use visit array , the memory is exceeded.

But I notice that because we are keep increasing the number and we are using bfs, we can check the min depth, so we don't have to check the visit array.
(There is no possibility of getting inf loop) 

After that do BFS. The starting location is a. Check if the number is same with B and if it is same the depth gonaa be the answer.



## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
