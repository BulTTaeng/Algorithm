# 14675_CutVertexAndBridge

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14675 

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we need at least N-1 edge to make N vertex connected, If we lost one of the edge(N-2) N nodes cannot be connected.

So, all edges are bridge.

In the same manner if some vertex have 2 or more edge, if we erase that vertex, the number of edges will become less than N-1.

So, if some vertex have 2 or more edges , that vertex is cut vertex.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
