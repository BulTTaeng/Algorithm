# 1043_Lie

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1043 

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , union_find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part is that we have to check that even if we meet someone don't know the truth in the party, we cannot always lying to them.

If there is someone who know the truth and that person(s) will have a party later, we cannot lie to them.

So, I tried to groupt them first.

By using union-find , when getting the input , I group people who are in the same party.

After that I recheck person in the first party to M party if there is someone who are in the group(knowing truth).

If someone in the party know the truth (find[truth] == find[person in the party]) I decrase the M.

After these seqeunce , I can find the solution.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
