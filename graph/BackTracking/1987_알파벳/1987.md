# 1987_Alphabet

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1987

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , back-tracking, dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Do dfs starting from (1,1). 

Because we want to erase the alphabet that we visited after one course is done, we have to make if not-visited.(back-tracking)

In here we don't need 20 * 20 size array because we only have to check some alphabet that we visited. The visit array will be 26 size(the number of alphabet in upperletter).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
