## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I almost reach to the key idea but I thought If I find the door , search keys if possible with recursive way.

But this idea is very tricky to implement.

So, I tried to save the location of door that I cannot open , and if we find new key, do bfs with the location of door that can be 

opened by founded new key.

I add one layer to every side of the input array , so all I need to do is bfs(0,0) ( not every edge location).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
