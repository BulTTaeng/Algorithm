# 18405_CompetitiveInfection

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/18405

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first try , I got TLE and at the second try I succeed.

In here we don't have to make a visit array because if that location is already infected, I cannot infected anymore.

I save all virus's location in v[the number of virus(1~K)]. After that I set the time and do infection if that location is not infected(0).

After infection , I add that location in v[j] vector.

However , I we keep adding and do searching , we will get TLE. This is because even thought we don't have to consider current time -1 infection location, we are still searching that location. If we already do infection in some location , we don't have to consider it anymore.

So, I clear that vector and copy new vector in that location.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
