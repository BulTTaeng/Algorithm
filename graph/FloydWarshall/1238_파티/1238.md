## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1238>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Floyd_Warshall

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Just use Floyd warshall.

Be careful that we have to consider int overflow and X->X case. (X to X is always 0 , so we don't have to consider it)

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
