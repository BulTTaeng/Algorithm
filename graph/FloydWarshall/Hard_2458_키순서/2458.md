# Hard_Floyd_2458_HeightOrder

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2458

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , floyd-warshall

## What was the key point and the hard part?

floyd-warshall algorithm can show shortest way  , path to every node to every node.

This means we can notice that it is connected to other nodes.

In this problem if we want to know the order of some person, 

(the number of person who is smaller than him(her) + the number of person who is bigger than him(her)) == the number of people -1

So, after doing floyd-warshall , inp[i][j] != INF means jth person is bigger than ith person and

inp[j][i] != INF means jth person is smaller than ith person.

So the sum of two should be the number of people -1.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
