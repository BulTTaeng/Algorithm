# Hard_1261_Algospot

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1261

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , 0-1 bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was think that I should use 0-1 bfs.

Because we did not count the cost of moving , push every empty location that is connected to the starting point(1,1).

While doing so , push_back all connected locations.

When we are done with empty location('0') we will check wall location('1') which we have to break only 1 wall.

We will scan empty location that we can reach when we break one wall.

So the sequence will be like this.

Black -> blue -> red

After that , when we reach (N , M) , print it and end.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
