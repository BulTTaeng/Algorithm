# 1012_OrganicCabbage

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1012

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph algorithm

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Check every section that cabbage exist and save the location in vector. This is for not checking every location (0~N ,0~M).

After that , grab out one of them and find all near location that cabbage exist by using BFS. If near location don't have cabbage, skip that location.

Check the location if it was visited.

Once every near location is checked ( = queue is empty), it means we need one worm to care that place. ( ans +1 )

At the end , ans will be the answer.

Becareful to check the edge point of visit array(or make visit much larger than N and M).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
