## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11657>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bellman-ford

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Just bellman-ford algorithm.

Be careful that if the input is

2 6000

1 2 -10000

2 1 -10000

repeated..

1 2 -10000

2 1 -10000


Then the int is out of range which shows print exceeded.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
