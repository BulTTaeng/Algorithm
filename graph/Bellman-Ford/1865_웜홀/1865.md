## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1865>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Bellman-Ford

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The problem is that If I fill distance with Max value provided by kotlin, It makes overflow and distance become minus value.

Except for that , starting from the first Node to N node, search every way connected and if It still update the shortest path after iterating N time, it means graph have 
minus cycle.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
