# 3184_Sheep

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3184

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Collect all location of wolfs. 

After that , starting from fist wolf's location(sequence does not matter) , search (i+1) , (i-1) , (j+1) , (j-1) if it is possible(range check)

Searching them by using visit array and count the number of wolf and sheep.

After searching is done, calculate (wolf >= sheep -> wolf survive , wolf < sheep -> sheep survivie) and reset the number of counted sheep and wolf.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
