# 17204_TheGameOfTheDeath

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17204

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph algorithm

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If there is a cycle except for friend and target is in the cycle, that is impossible case.

And cycle is made when revisit the node. This is because there is only one direction we can go in one node.

So, checking the how many times we move in the graph and visit , we can get the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
