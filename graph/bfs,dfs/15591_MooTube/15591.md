# 15591_MooTube

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15591

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because problem says that all nodes(videos) are connected, we don't have to make visit = false after dfs is done.

While doing dfs, if USADO is less then we want, we don't have to do dfs again because USADO is min value.

If min value of USADO is bigger or same with we wanted, that video will be counted as answer and continue dfs.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
