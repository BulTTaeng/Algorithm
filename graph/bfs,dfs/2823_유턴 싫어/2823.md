## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2823

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I upgrade this problem that all way is not connected.

For example, the input can be like this.

4 4

XX..

XX..

XXXX

..XX

In this case, mycode is searching all road(.) is possible to comeback.

At first, I think I can use visit array. However , If I use visit array, some part that is needed in another group can not be used.

For example,

4 4

..xx

....

xx..

xxxx

in this case, (1,2) can be visit = true if it first goes inside of queue.

In that case, this problme is changed in this way.

xxxx

xxx.

xx..

xxxx

which is no possible but the problem is possible.

If I solve this problem in right way, use visit array and search only one road(.) will work.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
