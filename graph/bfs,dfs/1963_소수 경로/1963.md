# 1963_PrimeNumberPath

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1963 

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Check 1000~9999 that it is prime number.

Save it in the array and do bfs for each number set.

If change one digit of number is prime number , put it in a queue with increased depth.

If we found the target number , print the target number. If we don't found it, print impossible.

Be aware that dividing num with 2 to sqrt(num) is checking the prime number.  

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
