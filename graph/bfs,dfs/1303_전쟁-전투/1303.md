# 1303_War_Battle

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1303

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I really don't know why problems say that m * n array not m * n array...

It is really wasting my time ㅡㅡ. I think I should spend more time to read the problem statement.

Save location of W and B in different vector.

Do BFS in W vector and B vector.

If some location is not visited, It means it is we solier, so add one.

When queue is empty , add num* num to the final answer and repeat it to vector's end.

Do same thing with B vector.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
