# 14940_EasyShortestPath

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14940

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Do bfs starting from the start point.

After filling ans array with depth of bfs, if some node is not visited and it is 1(possible to go there) make it -1.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
