# 17086_BabyShark

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17086

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we can get out of the loop if we meet the baby shark, BFS will much easier to check the depth.

Starting from every empty location(0) do BFS and if we meet the shark(1) , end the bfs and compare the depth.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
