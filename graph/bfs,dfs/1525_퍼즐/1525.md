## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1525>

## What Algorithm should I use?

bfs , map

## What was the key point and the hard part?

It is always hard to calculate time complexity of brute-force graph problem.

I thought i can use bfs to solve this , but i'm not sure with having visit array and it will solved in 1 second.

At first I think about using visit[10][10][10][10][10]..[10] array to save all possible case.

But there is onlue 32MD memory , I decided to use map.

Also, I use string to save memory.

I think time complexity will be O(4(4 direction to move) ^ 9(there is 3* 3 = 9 location) * 9 (thre is 9 numbers)  )

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
