# 5427_Fire

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/5427

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was I forget to check memory leak...

Because we don't want to save the location that is already have been fired, I have to save the location of fire where next location is empty or sangen.

Beside that , put location of fire in the queue and sangen's location in another queue and do bfs will work.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
