# 5567_결혼식

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/5567

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , DFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part here is we have to do search even after we already visit that node(friend).

This is because we have to count all friend's friends. If we stop if we visit that friends, we cannot search that friend's friends

I use DFS here. I think BFS will also work here.

If the friend limt (friend's friend's friend's friend can be also come to wedding ...) is very large , I think use BFS and count the depth of it will work faster.

By using depth parameter, I stop if depth is larger than 2.

If I did not count that friend and searching node is not me(!=1) I counted it.

I did not add 1 twice so I don't have to re visit the 1 node(me).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
