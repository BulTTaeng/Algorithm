## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/5014


## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm ,BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Not efficient to do DP because we don't know where is the possilbe location.

I use BFS to solve this.

Starting from current location , if it is possilbe to go down or up, add 1 to depth and to bfs.

If current location is same with goal location, stop.

If we cannot find the goal location, print use the stairs.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
