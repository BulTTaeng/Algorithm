# 1058_Friend

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1058

## What Algorithm should I use?

BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The problem statement is little bit tricky but 2-friend means friend and friend's friend.

So, only thing we have to do is add my friends(which is in i'th row) and my friend's friend.

Just careful to check visit array not to add friend that already counted!

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
