# 7569_Tomato

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/7569 

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , I tried to search every location unitil we don't have increasing tomato.

But this got TLE so I use queue.

Put every location of ripe tomato and if there is not riped tomato arount it , make it ripe and put it's location and depth to queue.

When queue is empty , if number of tomato is same with the number of tomato we get input, print the last depth of queue.

If not print -1.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
