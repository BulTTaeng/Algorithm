# 15900_EscapingTree

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15900

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because the number of moves that is needed is same with sum of depth of treee , if sum is even then 형석 win , otherwise , 성원 will win.

So, starting from the 1 node, do dfs and check if it is leaf node or not. Add all depth of the leaf node and checking it is even will give you the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
