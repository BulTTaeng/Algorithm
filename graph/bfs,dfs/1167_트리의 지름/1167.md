## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1167>

## What Algorithm should I use?

dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Becausse if we do dfs , no matter where the start point is, we always reach the one side of end point of tree.

After find one side of tree's end point , do dfs at end point and max cost of dfs is the diameter of tree.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
