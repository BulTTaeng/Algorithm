# 1926_Painting

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1926

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , DFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Save the location of 1 and do dfs.

If it was not visited before, it means it is new painting so add one.

In dfs, if new(not visited) 1 appear add 1 to painting's size.

After one dfs is done, reset the painting's size and repeat until every 1 is visited.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
