# 7562_KnightMoving

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/7562

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have to find min time of moving , so I think BFS will work more faster thatn dfs here.

Make a queue and push every possible location and depth in the queue.

After that if it matches to the target location break and print the answer.

Checking visit and range should be considered as well.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
