## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17836

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm, bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

While doing bfs , if we find gram, we can go shortest way. So current depth + (N-currx + M-curry) will give you the answer.

However, having gram will not give you shortest way , so we have to do bfs until we reach (N ,M) or q is empty.

Find min of (having gram  , not having gram). If min is bigger than T print Fail.

Else print answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
