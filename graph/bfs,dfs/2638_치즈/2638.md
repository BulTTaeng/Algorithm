# 2638_Cheese

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2638

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

First we have to know where is air.

The problem says that there is no cheese in the edge. 

I use dfs do detect air starting from (0,0) because (0,0) is edge.

After detecting air, do (0~N , 0~M) loop and check cheese should be melt or not. 

Again , like previouse problem that I solved , we should not update inp array immediatly.

In this time I use another array to save the changing statement.

There are some problem in the problem statement. 

If the input is 

2 2

0 0 

0 0 

then , the anser should be 0 not 1.

So , I think the proeblem should say that there is at least one cheese.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
