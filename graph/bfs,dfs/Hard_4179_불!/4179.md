# Hard_Simulation_4179_Fire

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/4179

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

In here , I fotgot to check visit array.

Because we don't want 지훈(J) to move to previouse location , we need to check visit.

After that  , check the fire and check J moves and if J's next move is out of range, print the answer.

If there is no direction that J can go , print IMPOSSIBLE.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
