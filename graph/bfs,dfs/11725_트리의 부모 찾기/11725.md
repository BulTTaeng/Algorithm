# 11725_FindingTreesParent

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11725

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , DFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Dfs and find out parent of tree.

At first I solve it with union- find but it was TLE. That is becuase I cannot update parent value.

After that do dfs and after dfs , setting parent got the right answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
