# 16234_PopulationMovement

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16234

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Knowing how to solve it was easy but implementation was complicated.

First , we have to find where to open.

Just checking which location is open is not sufficient. We need to know where to go.

So I make 2d vector and save possible location to go while search up , down , right , left.

After that I do dfs (0,0) to (N-1, N-1). When one dfs is done, I find the average that I visited , ans change the value.

When doing dfs (0,0) to (N-1, N-1) is done, reset everything except for value we get(changed in dfs) , do these sequence until we did not found possilbe case.



## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
