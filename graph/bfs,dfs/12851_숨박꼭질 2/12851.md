# 12851_HideAndSeek2

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/12851

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Do bfs.

visit = true should be in ther front of the loop because we need duplicates in the same depth.

or 

save visited location and make them visit if depth changes.

or

save the visited depth in the visit array and when it is not visited or visited in the same depth, push it to the queue.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
