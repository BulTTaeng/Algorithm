# 16173_JumpKingJelly_Small

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16173

## What Algorithm should I use?

BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I think I need to study BFS and DFS.

I think it need more explanation for this problem. Jelly cannot change the moving direction while it moves.

After that , be careful to check the visit and (n,n) location's value(because at (n,n) there is -1 which leads to inf loop), BFS will work.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
