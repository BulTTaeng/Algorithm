# 1697_HideAndSeek

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1697

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because we have x * 2 option, I think queue's memory will enought to do BFS.

Just checking the range, do BFS and save the depth will work.

Becareful that range is 0 to 100000 because we have x-1 option.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
