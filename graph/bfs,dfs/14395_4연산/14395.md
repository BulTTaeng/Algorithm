# 14395_4Calculation

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14395

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm ,bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

There is some key points here.

1. Making visit array 10^9 is very large. So use set or other data structure.

2. Rather then saving previous num and calculator in the visit array and do recursion ( which I think first) , use string .

3. Because we want ASCII sequence , do * first and do / at last as problem stated.

After that doing bfs like before will work.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
