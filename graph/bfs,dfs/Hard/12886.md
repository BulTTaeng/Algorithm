## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/12886>

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The number of C can be guessed by the number of SUM - (a + b).

So, we don't need 3d visit array , we just need 2D array.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
