# 3055_Escape

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/3055

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs , simulation

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was understanding the sequence.

Does we have to move water first or move hedgehog first?

If we move water first, we might erase the hedgehog even if hedgehog can escape. Moving water first was not the answer.

If we move hedgehog first and does not goes to the water, we can get a answer.

because we can overlap hedgehog with water if we save all possible moves of hedgehog.

If there is no hedgehog left, print KAKTUS.

Remember that we should not change the input array directly , we need copy array or queue to save updates.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
