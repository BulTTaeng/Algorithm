# 13565_Penetration

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/13565

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Save the location of first row and inp[i][j] == '0'

After that do bfs in every saved location and if row reaches to the end, it is possible.

If it is not possible after we all searched saved location, it is no possible.

At first I though there is a space in the input. I get the input as int but I was weird.

After that I change the input as char and it works.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
