# 2589_보물섬

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2589

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because BFS time complexity is O(edge + node) , If we do BFS at every location then time complexity of this problem is 50 * 50 * O(2500 * 4 + 50).

I'm sure that I will work in time limit, so I use BFS in every location and find the max depth.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
