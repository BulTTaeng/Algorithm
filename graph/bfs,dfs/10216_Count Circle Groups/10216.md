# 10216_CountCircleGroups

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/10216

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Save all location and range of enemy.

After that starting from the first enemy, if some enemy is in the range, do dfs.

Running dfs means that there is enemy location that is not detected, so increase the number of answer and do dfs.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
