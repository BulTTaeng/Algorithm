# 11724_ConnectedComponent

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/11724

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS , Union Find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I solve this problem with 2 algorithm.

1. BFS

Searching from first node to n node, do BFS. If that node is not visited , which means I it not belong to anywhere we searched, increase answer.

2. Union Find

Union Find is to find disjoint set. But if we use it well, it can be used to find cycle and connectedcomponent.

Do union find and checkout the number of unique value of find(first node to n node).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
