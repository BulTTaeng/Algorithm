# 16928_SnackAndLadderGame

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16928

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was I have to put every case in the for loop (for loop for rolling dice i=1~6).

If we put snack and ladder case in ouside of for loop, rolling dice in that situation is not considered.

If there is a snack and ladder in next location, we have to check start location and destination location.

If we don't consider start location, It will work but I will work more slower.

So, make both location as visited, save the depth and do BFS.

If number is same with 100, the depth of it will be an answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
