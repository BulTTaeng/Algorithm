# 17070_MoveThePipe1

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17070

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , It might be seem hard but, only we have to know is that the end part of pipe.

While moving left pipe to left pipe or vertical pipe to vertical pipe, we only have to consider (x , y+1) or (x+1 , y).

When we move pipe int diagonal direction, we have to consider (x-1, y) , (x+1, y+1) , (x, y-1) have wall or not.

Of course , we have to consider the range, however because we starting from (1,2) to (N,N) and there is no possibility of x or y decrease. 

So we only have to check (x+1 , y+1) is in range even though we are moving pipe in diagonal direction.

We don't have to check visit either because we are counting possible cases.

When pipe reache to (N, N) , count it and finally print the answer works.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
