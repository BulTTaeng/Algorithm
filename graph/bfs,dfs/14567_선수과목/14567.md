# 14567_Prerequisite

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14567

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm ,bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because every prerequisite is less than the course , we have to do bfs starting from 1 to N.

However althought some node is already visited, when we found more prerequisite before, we have to do bfs again because we need more semester to learn that course.

Of course , if that course is prerequisite of other courses , other courses should be revisited.

So, I use int visit array to save max depth of some node. If some node found bigger depth, push it again in a queue and do bfs again. 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
