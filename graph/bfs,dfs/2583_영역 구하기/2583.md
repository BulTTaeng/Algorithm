# 2583_FIndTheArea

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2583

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I don't know why but I thought I have to avoid duplicates.

So, I make a [10002] array and check true if that area is founded.

I kept failed and I cannot find the error or mistake. But I notice that I have print the duplicates as well... So I use vector to print the result.

The solution is simeple, check all location in the rectangle and make them visited. 

If it is not visited, run dfs.

Push the area detected in the vector and reset the variable of area every time dfs.

Add one to ans if dfs is done.

Print all the saved value is the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
