# 13023_ABCDE

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/13023

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm ,dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar problem with 1405 Crazy Robot.

The key point is that we might visit D friend first if A - B , B - C , C - D , D - E , A-D.

In this case, dfs might visit A - D - E first and not visit A - B - C - D - E.

So, we have to visit = false before return.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
