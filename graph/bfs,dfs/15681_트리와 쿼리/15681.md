# 15681_TreeAndQuery

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15681

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm ,dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , I save the parent of each node and count child node with recursion.

This got TLE.

After that , I save the parents nodes in the vector and when I meet the new child node , add 1 to all parents node.

This got TLE too.

After that, I save all the child node in vector. This require 100001 vector so this got memory lack.

Finally I set the number of child in a int array. While doing dfs , I just set number of child of node = 1.

When we reach leaf node and there is no way to visit except for parent node, after returned , I add the number of child in leaf node to leaf node's parent.

By doing this until we reach the root give clear solution.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
