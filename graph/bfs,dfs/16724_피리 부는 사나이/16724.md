## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16724>

## What Algorithm should I use?

BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , I did not chekc that there is a input that is out of range.

so, my code include dealing with out of range input.

We can check the visit array and if we visited before, it means we can reuse safe zone builded for that location.

If next visiting place is visited in current bfs , we should make a new safe zone.

Other algorithm to solve this will be dfs or union-find.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
