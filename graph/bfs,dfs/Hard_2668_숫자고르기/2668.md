# Hard_2668_숫자 고르기

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2668 

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , I tried with union find but if there problem does not have first state. 

So, I tried it with dfs but I don't know how to detect cycle with dfs.

The solution was pretty simple.

Do dfs at every node starting from 1 ( because we need increasing number).

If it is maded to reach starting node, It means the starting node is one part of cycle.

Add that node to the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
