## What is the problem?

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first, I try to solve it with dp and dfs.

However , because there is so many case and +1 , -1 takes so long to do dfs.

So, I tried it with bfs. Bfs is more suitable in this case because after we found the stone m , we can get out of the loop.

The tricky part was setting range. At first , I think n ~ m+max(a,b) wiil work. However, because we have * a * b calculation, we have to search to the end. Also, 동규 might go back frist and jump, which means we have to calculate the case 0 to 100000.

After that doing bfs using visit array, and if the number is same with m, break the loop and show the answer works!

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
