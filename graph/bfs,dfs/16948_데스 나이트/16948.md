## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm, BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Do BFS starting from the start location.

Save the depth and if it arrive at the destiantion location, depth will be the answer.

If it never goes in to destination after searching all possible case, the answer will be -1.
