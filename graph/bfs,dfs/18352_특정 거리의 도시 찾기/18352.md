# 18352_특정 거리의 도시 찾기

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/18352

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Because graph is one-way edge graph, we have to consider it.

After saving every starting city and destination city that we can go, do BFS and if the depth is same with k, save it in the answer vector.

Sorting the answer vector and show the final answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
