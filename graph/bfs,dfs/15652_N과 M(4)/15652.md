## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15652>

## What Algorithm should I use?

back - tracking

## What was the key point and the hard part?

We have to consider selecting same number.

Because we have to print it in increasing order , I started with number 1.

To not print 2,1 if we print 1,2 , I set the current location in the parameter and use for loop to add the (current number to M) in the vector.

If the vector size reaches M, print all the value in the vector.

Pop vector after back tracking is done because we don't need to consider same situation.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
