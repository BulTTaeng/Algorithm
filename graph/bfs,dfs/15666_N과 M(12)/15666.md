## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15666>

## What Algorithm should I use?

back tracking

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar with 15663.

Only we have to do is set parameter for curr location of dfs.

Because we accept duplicates , duplicates number does not have a meaning. So , unique can be one of the solution.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
