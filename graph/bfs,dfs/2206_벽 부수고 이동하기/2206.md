# 2206_BreakTheWallAndMove

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2206

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar to problem mirror(previouse one).

We have to consider if we break the wall or not when visiting some location.

This means we need visit[1001][1001][2] size array. This means visit[x loc] [y loc] [we break the wall or not].

So, if we already break the wall before, we can only go to place that does not have a wall and , we have to check we break the wall or not.

I use struct to solve this, and doing bfs works.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
