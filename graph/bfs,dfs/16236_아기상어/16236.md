## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/16236>

## What Algorithm should I use?

bfs , sorting , simulation 

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part was that I have to check all fish in the same distance.

Even though I search Top -> left -> right - > bottom, It still finds (x,y) -> left->bottom first compare to (x,y) -> right -> top.

I use prorityqueue to solve to check the next location.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
