# 1260_DFSAndBFS

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1260

## What Algorithm should I use?

DFS and BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I always miss some part when implementing BFS or DFS.

This is good chance to implement it by my self.

To search from small number, I use vector and sort the vector. At first I think priority queue but vector is more easy I think.

After that, run DFS and BFS algorithm.

Don't forget to reset the visit array.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
