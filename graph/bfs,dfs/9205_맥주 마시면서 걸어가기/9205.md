# 9205_WalkingWithBeer

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/9205

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , bfs.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

I failed a lot because I thought it is Euclidean distance. It is Manhatten distance. 

Read problem cafefully!!

Save all convienient store and rock festival location in vector.

After that starting from start location, if is possible to go , push it in a queue.

If queue's value is same with rock festival, it means it is possible.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
