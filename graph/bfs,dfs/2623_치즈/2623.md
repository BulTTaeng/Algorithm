# 2636_Cheese

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2636

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm, dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The air that is not seperated by cheese == air that is connected to outside == do dfs starting from the edge.

So, do dfs at (0,0) and find the air that is not in hole. After that , searching from (0,0) to (N ,M), melt cheese that is near to air.

Repeat this steps. Beaware that we have to do dfs at every step so we can check that hole is now connected to air.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
