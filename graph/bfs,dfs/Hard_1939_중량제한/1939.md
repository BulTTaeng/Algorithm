# Hard_Binary_1939_WeightLimit

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1939

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , binary search , bfs(dfs)

## What was the key point and the hard part?

*Fail to solve it by myself*

It was very hard to think that I have to use binary search.

At first, because we are lookint for max (min value of each possible way) , I though using dfs will work.

However, I got TLE. So, I wonder a lot and search it in the internet.

This is because we have too many edges (1000000000)

The first thing I saw is that binary search.

Starting from lowest edge to largest edge , we will do binary search.

Of course , to do binary search we have to sort edges.

If middle value reach to the end point, raise the value in binary search and do bfs(dfs) again.
If middle value cannot reach to  the end point , decrease the value and do bfs(dfs).

At the end , the end(max weight we can get) value will be the answer.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
