# 2573_Iceberg

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2573

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , dfs

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The hard part here is we should not update the input data after computing.

Because we save the melted iceberg's height right after we compute and it is melted, adjacent icebergs will melt more than we think.

For example, 

0 0 0 0

0 1 5 0

0 0 0 0

should be

0 0 0 0

0 0 2 0

0 0 0 0

not 

after  (1,1) iceberg melted

0 0 0 0

0 0 5 0

0 0 0 0

then we compute (1,2)

0 0 0 0

0 0 1 0

0 0 0 0

So, I save all value in another queue , and update when we meet next year icebergs location.

Counting the lands will be same as how many times bfs or dfs is called (0,0) to (N-1, M-1).

Making the same size array with input and updatee it after melting process is done will be another solution.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
