# 1389_KevinBaconsSixStepRule

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1389

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm, BFS

## What was the key point and the hard part?

BFS is good way to find the min distance.

Starting from 1 to n , reset visit , num(array to save the distance from current node) and do bfs.

While doing BFS, save the distance from start node.

After BFS is done, add all value in num array to ans[start node] array, then repeat it.

After that , printing the min value index will work.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
