# 1647_CityDivisionPlan

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1647

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , MST , union-find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

At first , It was hard to find the way to divide the city.

The solution was simple. Do MST search and find the last edge that is unioned.

When we find MST , the largest cost edge in the MST will be lasted added one.

So, (MST edge ) - (last edge that is added to MST) will be the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
