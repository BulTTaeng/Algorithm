# 4386_MakingConstellation

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/4386

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , MST

## What was the key point and the hard part?

If we can connect every stars , it means there is a edge between every 2 star(complete graph)

So, find the edge's weight (distance) of every edge and do MST algorithm.

MST

Use priority queue to get smallest edges, if two nodes is already connected(use union- find) , pass and if not , add the edges's weight to MST distance. 

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
Thank you for visiting this github!
