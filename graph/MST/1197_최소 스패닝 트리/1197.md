# 1197_MST

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1197

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , Kruskal , union-find

## What was the key point and the hard part?

**If there is a cycle , it is not MST!!!**

Exactly same with Kruskal algorithm.

Selecting from min edge, check all edge and if two nodes are not connected(use union-find) add that edge to the answer.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
