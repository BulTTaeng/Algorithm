# 2056_Work

made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2056

## What Algorithm should I use?

Graph Algorithm , topological sort , implementation.

## What was the key point and the hard part?

First , I tried it with dfs but I got TLE.

Next , I think that because all the previouse work have the less number , the finish time to do previouse work starting from first work will can be saved.

So, while getting the input, I find the max time of (parent work time + current work time) and save the time to finish 'i'th work.

Doing this until 'N'th work and find the max (1 ~ N) work time will be the answer.


I search it in the internet to find better solution. Other guys are saying that this is topological sort.

I write the code to understand the topological sort(2056_topo_sort.cpp).

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
