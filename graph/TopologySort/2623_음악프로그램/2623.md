## What is the problem?

<https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2623>

## What Algorithm should I use?

topology sort

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Use topology sort to print the sequence.

If there is a cycle in the graph , We cannot finish topology sort.

So, by adding the sequnce in to the vector, if the sequnce vector size is less than N, it means it is impossible.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is wogur7496@gmail.com.
